# JPMC Task 2
This repository contains files for Task 2 of the J.P. Morgan Software Engineering Virtual Job Experience. I learned how to access the JPMC Perspective framework and properly output a graph of stock price data feeds as the client gathered real-time data from the web application, using Node.js, React, and TypeScript.
